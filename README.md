# About

A side-scrolling video game, sometimes shortened to side-scroller, is a game in which the action is viewed from a side-view camera angle and the screen follows the player as they move left or right. The jump from single-screen or flip-screen graphics to scrolling graphics during the golden age of arcade games was a pivotal leap in game design, comparable to the move to 3D graphics during the fifth generation.
